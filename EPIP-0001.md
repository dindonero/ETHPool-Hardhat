# ETH Pool Improvement Proposal 0001

### Motivation

One way for a user to receive interest on a token held for long periods of time is to lock it in the ETHPool contract.
The Graph team will use the funds to implement new features and improve the protocol.
The team will periodically deposit ETH in the contract as an incentive for token holders, enabling long-term depositors to withdraw their tokens with interest.

The issue with having a single entity as the only rewards depositor is that it limits the amount of sources who could raise the value of the vault.
As a result, users that lock their tokens in the contract will be restricted to only be able to benefit from the investments and profits generated by the team.

The goal of this proposal is to improve revenue for the token suppliers by allowing for a more varied investment portfolio.

### Implementation

The **ETHPool** contract is the contract responsible for managing the ETH funds.
Currently, it reverts if any other depositor than the team tries to transfer ETH to the contract without making a user deposit.
In order for anyone to offer prizes to the pool's users, our approach would rely on the removal of this check.

### Changes
* Remove the *msg.sender* check from the *depositRewards* function.
